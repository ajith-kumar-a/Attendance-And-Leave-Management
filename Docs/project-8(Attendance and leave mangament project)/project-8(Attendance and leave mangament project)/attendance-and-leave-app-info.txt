For the student, teacher, and staff attendance app in React, you can organize the project into several modules, sections, and tables to cover all required functionalities. Here's a detailed breakdown.
1. Modules
* Authentication Module
o Handles login, registration, and profile management for students, teachers, and staff.
* Dashboard Module
o Provides a centralized view for users based on their roles (student, teacher, staff).
* Attendance Module
o Manages daily attendance records for students, teachers, and staff.
* Leave Management Module
o Allows users to apply for leave, view leave history, and manage leave requests.
* Reports Module
o Generates attendance and leave reports for analysis and record-keeping.
* Admin Module
o Provides administrative controls for managing users, roles, and permissions.
2. Sections
* Login/Registration
o User login (Students, Teachers, Staff)
o Registration form for new users (optional if only admins create accounts)
o Profile management
* Dashboard
o Overview of attendance, leave requests, and notifications
o Role-specific information display (e.g., student attendance summary, teacher attendance records)
* Attendance Management
o Mark attendance (Students, Teachers, Staff)
o View attendance history
o Update or correct attendance records
* Leave Management
o Apply for leave (Sick Leave, Holiday, Absent)
o View leave status and history
o Admin approval/rejection of leave requests
* Reports
o Generate and download attendance reports
o View monthly/weekly attendance statistics
o Leave summary reports
* Admin Panel
o Manage users (create, update, delete)
o Define roles and permissions
o Configure leave types and policies
o Monitor system usage and performance
3. Database Tables
* Users
o id (Primary Key)
o name
o email
o password
o role (Student, Teacher, Staff, Admin)
o profile_picture
o created_at
o updated_at
* Attendance
o id (Primary Key)
o user_id (Foreign Key to Users table)
o date
o status (Present, Absent)
o remarks (Optional notes)
o created_at
o updated_at
* Leave Requests
o id (Primary Key)
o user_id (Foreign Key to Users table)
o leave_type (Sick Leave, Holiday, Absent)
o start_date
o end_date
o status (Pending, Approved, Rejected)
o reason
o created_at
o updated_at
* Roles
o id (Primary Key)
o role_name (Student, Teacher, Staff, Admin)
o created_at
o updated_at
* Permissions
o id (Primary Key)
o role_id (Foreign Key to Roles table)
o permission_name
o created_at
o updated_at
* Leave Types
o id (Primary Key)
o name (Sick Leave, Holiday, Absent)
o description
o created_at
o updated_at
4. Additional Considerations
* Notifications
o You might want to include a notifications table to handle alerts for leave approvals, attendance updates, etc.
* Audit Logs
o To track changes made by admins or users, consider an audit log table
1. Users Table
* Relationships:
o Users have a one-to-many relationship with Attendance (one user can have multiple attendance records).
o Users have a one-to-many relationship with Leave Requests (one user can submit multiple leave requests).
o Users have a many-to-one relationship with Roles (each user has one role, but each role can belong to many users).
2. Roles Table
* Relationships:
o Roles have a one-to-many relationship with Users (each role can be assigned to multiple users).
o Roles have a one-to-many relationship with Permissions (each role can have multiple permissions).
3. Attendance Table
* Relationships:
o Attendance has a many-to-one relationship with Users (each attendance record is linked to one user).
4. Leave Requests Table
* Relationships:
o Leave Requests has a many-to-one relationship with Users (each leave request is submitted by one user).
o Leave Requests has a many-to-one relationship with Leave Types (each leave request corresponds to a specific leave type).
5. Permissions Table
* Relationships:
o Permissions have a many-to-one relationship with Roles (each permission is associated with one role).
6. Leave Types Table
* Relationships:
o Leave Types have a one-to-many relationship with Leave Requests (each leave type can be associated with multiple leave requests).
Visual Representation
Here's how these relationships would look in an entity-relationship diagram (ERD):
1. Users Table
o One-to-Many with Attendance Table: Each user (user_id) can have multiple attendance records (user_id in the Attendance table).
o One-to-Many with Leave Requests Table: Each user (user_id) can submit multiple leave requests (user_id in the Leave Requests table).
o Many-to-One with Roles Table: Each user (role_id) is associated with one role (id in the Roles table).
2. Roles Table
o One-to-Many with Users Table: Each role (id) can be assigned to multiple users (role_id in the Users table).
o One-to-Many with Permissions Table: Each role (role_id) can have multiple permissions (role_id in the Permissions table).
3. Attendance Table
o Many-to-One with Users Table: Each attendance record (user_id) is associated with one user (id in the Users table).
4. Leave Requests Table
o Many-to-One with Users Table: Each leave request (user_id) is associated with one user (id in the Users table).
o Many-to-One with Leave Types Table: Each leave request (leave_type_id) corresponds to one leave type (id in the Leave Types table).
5. Permissions Table
o Many-to-One with Roles Table: Each permission (role_id) is associated with one role (id in the Roles table).
6. Leave Types Table
o One-to-Many with Leave Requests Table: Each leave type (id) can be associated with multiple leave requests (leave_type_id in the Leave Requests table).
Example ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) Structure
* Users ? user_id (PK) ? Attendance
* Users ? user_id (PK) ? Leave Requests
* Roles ? role_id (PK) ? Users
* Roles ? role_id (PK) ? Permissions
* Leave Types ? leave_type_id (PK) ? Leave Requests
This diagram would show the primary keys (PK) and foreign keys (FK) linking the tables, reflecting the relationships described above. The "one-to-many" relationships indicate how one record in a table (e.g., a User) can be linked to many records in another table (e.g., multiple Attendance records)
