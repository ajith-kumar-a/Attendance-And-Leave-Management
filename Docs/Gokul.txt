download pdf 
package -> npm install jspdf --save
        -> npm install html2canvas --save

how it is working :
    html2canvas: Captures the HTML content and converts it to a canvas element.
    jsPDF: Takes the canvas data and adds it to a PDF document.
    imgWidth and imgHeight: Ensures the image fits within an A4-sized PDF.

ouput:
    When you click the "Download as PDF" button, the visible HTML content within the contentToConvert div will be captured and downloaded as a PDF.
